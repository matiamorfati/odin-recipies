This is my very first project, will be using only HTML for now, maybe in future spice it up wits some CSS.
Using basic HTML functionalities:
-Creating html boilerplate from scratch
-Using simple text editing functionalities
-Using images and links
-Learning to use git properly
PROJECT IS DONE:
it was quite easy i am not gonna lie. looking forward to build next projects!
I am aware of my not really propper use of git, but i will try to polish it. UPDATE: new assingment add css files to the project
